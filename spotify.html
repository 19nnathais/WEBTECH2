Sia's popularity has not gone unnoticed by Spotify with her featuring on over fifteen Spotify premium playlists for three weeks running, this is one of the longest periods that an artist has been featured and is a sign of respect for Sia’s work.

                  <p>Vampire Weekend is another great creator and they are known for their unique style of indie music, they have also had great success in recent years with many appearances on very popular Spotify playlist recommendations. The playlists that are made are based upon what songs are popular within each genre of music, so the fact that they have been shown so much reflects just how many people out there are listening to their music and subscribing to their accounts to keep up to date with their latest tracks.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>The Weeknd is a relatively current artist in terms of being popular and the fact that he has many appearances placing high on a mix of music charts all over the world. His unique and very relaxing style of rap, hip hop music has proven to be extremely popular, especially during 2020 it seems that we were all looking to The Weeknd to provide some much-needed therapy during these troubling times. He has had many hit songs appear all over the range of relaxing pop playlists that Spotify provides featuring songs like Blinding Lights and Starboy to name a few.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>A classic artist to find success very early on in his time on Spotify would have to be rap and R&B artist Macklemore, his work as a stand-alone artist as well as his with other stars such as Ed Sheeran and Kesha have proven to be very popular. The success of his latest album called Gemini would have to be one of the best albums he has created and the listening rates on Spotify are a great example of why he has been so successful, his songs have made several appearances on Spotify playlists meaning that he has a large following on the application.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>Lewis Capaldi would have to be one of the quickest music success stories to ever occur, since the summer release of his single Someone, You Loved and the swift release of his first album soon after he has become quite a sensation. Lewis is known for the high range of his voice and his love story appeal that he brings to his music and this has done him very well in terms of creating some pretty good music. He has been seen on many Spotify official playlists and for good reason with his relaxing songs, I don't think that his success is going to falter any time soon.

                  <p>The final breakout star on this list that has seen much success both in general and on Spotify would be fall out Boy, their high energy music and amazing vocals have seen them see much growth in popularity with every album. They have had many songs featured in popular Spotify play; lists and have had a huge amount of people following their accounts and listening to their music.
