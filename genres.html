            <h1>Genres</h1>
            <p>A music genre is a standard classification that distinguishes some pieces of music as bearing on shared history or set of precepts. Music can be found in various forms and varieties from traditional rock music to world pop, effortless listening, and bluegrass. Many genres have a tremendous historical or geographical importance, a cult following or music origins that go far beyond the 20th century. As genre distinctions dissipate, various genres of music undergo huge quantities of genre crossover. Throughout history, artists from various genres tend to be associated with a particular genre and can make music across various genres. Comprehending various kinds of musical genre help compose music and is a massive part of musical progression. Even if you do not like some genres, it is still crucial to comprehend what makes them diverse to discover your own sound. Discovering various kinds of genres is a great starting point for analysing and recognising how styles have evolved. It is also a terrific way to see how they have swayed contemporary culture across the globe. When examining music, we can designate a classification based upon different musical components. Genres can be specified using instruments. We might categorise it as classical music if the piece was played in a particular style utilising orchestral instruments. If the instruments were exceptionally distorted guitars, we would categorise this music genre as rock or heavy metal. Some genres are based upon instruments and timing. Blues music utilises a series of patterns and is played by a conventional live band utilising guitar and a drum set. Drum and bass use a quick bpm and is mostly electronic.

               <p>Music is a vast realm. There are countless genres, sub-genres, and styles, from World Music to Rap, from Rock to Jazz. On the one hand, the list could be extremely long. On the other hand, not all genres are as popular and as successful. As a result, the music industry, or the music market, surely favors some of these to the detriment of others.

                    <p>As the label itself indicates, pop music is surely the most popular genre in the music market. It is a bit tricky, however, to clearly define what pop music is, as it has evolved so much through time.
                        We could say that any genre gaining massive popularity becomes pop music. As an example, The Beatles were pop, although, from a genre point of view, they produced mainly soft rock tracks. Throughout the Eighties, pop music evolved towards more electronic sounds, with artists and songs bridging the gap between the classic rock form (deriving from the Blues) and modern approaches to music that led us directly to the digital era.
                        Nowadays, pop music takes much of its sounds and musical language from the world of hip-hop, with its sub-genres of trap and rap being extremely popular. Electronic and dance elements are still very present in the mainstream, with other influences, such as Latin sounds, often joining in to create a diverse and eclectic approach.

                        The encounter between spoken words and electronic sounds made music doable without the traditional tools, like a good singing voice or the ability to play an instrument.
